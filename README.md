## 🌿 About the Site

This website is built as a **single page application** (SPA) using **HTML/CSS/JS**.
The goal is to create a calm, accessible, and informative experience for our participants.

- **CSS (Modular)** – Modern CSS features like Grid, Flexbox, and custom properties
- **JavaScript (ES2023)** – Leveraging ECMAScript 2023 features (Node.js v20+)
- **Future-ready** – Built to allow migration to React or component-based frameworks
